# Bitburner-scripts

This is my personal repo including some scripts for Bitburner. Repo inspired by https://github.com/ChaelCodes/bitburner-scripts

## Start
You must run the install.js file

> `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlejandroGomezFrieiro/bitburner-scripts/main/install.js install.js
`

Configure your Import
You can configure your import inside import.js.
```
    config = {
        folder: 'scripts',
        rootUrl: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlejandroGomezFrieiro/bitburner-scripts/main/',
        serverPrefix: 'AlejandroGomezFrieiro',
    };
```

- `folder` will determine where your scripts are stored
- `rootUrl` is the source, if you fork this repo, update this to you repo
- `serverPrefix` your automatically purchased servers will be filtered from auto hacks using this prefix. Pick a fun name!

# Run your import!
`run install.js` will tell you if everything worked. Please reach out and create an issue for troubleshooting. Please include your import.js, and make sure your forked repo is public!
